# StatusZ - K8s Native Status Monitoring Tool

StatusZ is an open-source project aimed at providing a Kubernetes-native status monitoring solution. Users can effectively monitor availability of both their internal kubernetes-based applications and external services beyond the cluster boundaries.

**Note:** This README provides an overview of the project and its goals. As the project progresses, more detailed information about installation, usage, and contribution guidelines will be added.

## Features

- Monitor the status of services deployed in Kubernetes.
- Monitor third-party APIs or websites for availability.
- Keep track of Kubernetes batch jobs or traditional cron jobs.
- Extend functionality with additional features through contributions.
